## Motivation

Students in SUST have to consult with the Tuition media groups on Facebook in order to get tutoring jobs. These media groups often claim a hefty amount of the tutor's first-month salary that can be up to 70% of the tutor's fee itself.

Building a network of students(potential tutors) and parents where tutoring jobs will be introduced, will be a great save of money for the students.


For Tutors
---

- The Tutor will sign up using the SUST edu student mail provided from SUST (e.g raisa50@student.sust.edu) and provide all relevant information required for signing up.
- A verification link will be sent to the provided email and the tutor has to verify the link. After then he can log into the application with his email and password. 
- After login, the tutor will be sent to a page. They can then navigate through the app using the Bottom navigation bar.  
- The tutor can toggle between three screens - 
	- **My Profile:** A profile screen will appear with the information of the logged-in tutor. 
	- **Browse Students:** This is a feed of all available students looking for tutors through the app. The students are presented in list tiles format. A tutor can directly call the student to the mobile number provided by the student, through the IconButton placed at the right of each tile.
	- **See Tutors:** This screen has the list of all the tutors registered in the app. This page consists of a list of tiles for each tutor. The user can navigate to any particular tutor's profile by tapping on the tiles.

- After the application is launched and the user taps on the "Sign in as Parent" text button, the user is redirected to a page, and is required to input a Referrer's SUST mail in the form. This refferer must be a student of SUST, therefore the mail should be a SUST student mail.  
- A verification link is then sent to the referrer's SUST student mail. The referrer has to verify the link in order for the referred user to sign up.
- After the verification, the user can sign up by providing the required information, and this time an email will be sent to the user's own email. The user has to verify and then they can log in to the application. 
- After login, the user will be sent to a page. They can then navigate through the app using the Bottom navigation bar.  They can toggle between these screens:
	- **My Profile:** This consists of the information provided by the user.
